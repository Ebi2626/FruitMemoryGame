Fruit Memory Game
=====================

It is a simple game written in a mixture of vanillia.js and jQuery in order to train my skills in these technologies.

About the game
-----------------
It is a game which improves our short-term memory possibilities. You have to click on one of the cards to display its obverse and remember what fruit is that. Then you have to click on another card to check if its obverse is the same as the previous one. If you hit the same, you will receive a point. The less movement you will do the better your result will be. After a successful game, you can click "play again" and try to beat your record. Enjoy!

About the tech
----------------
- The randomizing script allows as to play the game many times (based on filter function and Math object)
- Smart "if-else" statement checks if the player tries to cheat and display an alert
- ES6 syntax allows to shorten code and make it more readable
- jQuery allows making code easier to write
